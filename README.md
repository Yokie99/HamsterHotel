- There is a white bar on the right side of the screen
-For the NavBar the Logo has too much spacing left and right. On the Figma, the text and logo are evenly spaced. When you hover the NavBar the color is supposed to be white. 
- For the Welcome to a hamster's Paradise there is too much white space at the top. The image of the hamster is too tall. The awards are supposed to be closer to the bottom of the image. I think when you change the height of the hamster it will look more like the Figma. Too much white space at the bottom. 
- For the Our Rooms. The Title (Our Rooms) isn't supposed to be all caps and it's a different font. The cards are too spaced apart and the width of the cards look too small. Cards are supposed to have sharp edges. The square feet of the room is supposed to be bold.
- For packages the images are stretched. The for each package titles it's supposed to be lower than the picture.
- For the amenities, the icons are too spaced apart. The text aren't the same as the Figma.
- For the reserve a room, the boxes need to be sharper. The title needs more space padding at the top.
- For the footer, you need more padding at the top and bottom.

- You forgot a lot of alt tags.

- For laptop mode, items are center, a lot of extra white space for the welcome to a hamster, and packages. The reserve button is out of place.

- Mobile version has a huge white line on the right. The welcome hamster picture is hugging the left.
- Your reserve a room is hugging the left. I think it would look nice if you centered it.

- I like how your mobile version the packages and rooms you can scroll through them.

- adjusted the white space in the award section 
- changed the font for "our rooms" and used corrected casing
- corrected the spacing for the room cards using margins
